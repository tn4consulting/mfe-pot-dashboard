// register-scds.ts imports `defineCustomElements` from the Stencil-generated
// '@tn4consulting/shared-ui-scds-core/loader' subpath, not just the bare
// package -- but sharedUiScdsCoreFederationDependency's
// `includeSecondaries: false` (deliberately set to dodge the same
// jsx-runtime-style auto-discovery bug documented in
// shared-federation-config/react.js) means only the bare specifier is in
// the shared import map, so this subpath was never resolvable ("Unable to
// resolve specifier '@tn4consulting/shared-ui-scds-core/loader'") --
// confirmed live: dashboard's federated `./Component` failed to load
// entirely (RemoteErrorBoundary fallback) until this was added. Same fix
// as job-bank's federation.config.mjs, until this can be folded into the
// published package properly.

// React remote -- imports the framework-agnostic config API, not the
// Angular wrapper's re-export. Shares react/react-dom (both exposed
// entries mount directly inside a host's own React tree) plus
// shared-federation-runtime (`./Component` needs it for the job-bank/EI
// widget-loader Contexts Overview.tsx consumes -- sharing it for the
// whole app is harmless and simpler than splitting shared config per
// expose) plus shared-ui-scds-core (this app renders scds-card/
// scds-heading/scds-notice/scds-badge/etc. directly -- GCDS has been
// removed from the family entirely, closing a real pre-existing gap: this
// app never shared either design-system singleton despite rendering one
// directly).
//
// Only `./Component` and `./PaymentHistoryWidget` are exposed now -- no
// `./RemoteProviders`. That export existed only to carry Angular DI
// providers across the federation boundary for RemoteRouteHost to apply
// via a child EnvironmentInjector. A React remote has no DI tree for a
// host to populate -- both exposed components do all of their own setup
// on mount instead (see App.tsx and PaymentHistory.tsx).
